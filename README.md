# TrainTimes

#Purpose
This application demonstrates the ability to interact with a database (Firebase). Users can add a train to the schedule. This information is then loaded into the Database, and upon call back moments.js is used to calculate the next arrival time and minutes left to arrival. This is then loaded into the table.

I've also added a display of the current time within the jumbotron header and used modals to alert users of a succesful or unsuccesful schedule addition.

#Technology Used
  -HTML
  -CSS (Including Bootstrap and Google Fonts)
  -Javascript and jQuery
  -Moments.js

#Future Enhancements
  -Include Update and Remove buttons within the display table, to allow users to remove or edit the train schedule, and update the firebase with this information as well.
  -Update the minutes to arrival in real time, without a page refresh.

#Image Credits
