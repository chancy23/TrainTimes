## TrainTimes

### Purpose
This application demonstrates the ability to interact with a database (Firebase). Users can add a train to the schedule. This information is then loaded into the Database, and upon call back moments.js is used to calculate the next arrival time and minutes left to arrival. This is then loaded into the table.

I've also added a display of the current time within the jumbotron header and used modals to alert users of a succesful or unsuccesful schedule addition.

This app is deployed at: https://chancy23.github.io/TrainTimes/
